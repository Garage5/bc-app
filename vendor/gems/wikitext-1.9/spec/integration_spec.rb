      Now check out the alternative blockquote syntax:
      
      <blockquote>
      This type of syntax is useful for
      when you have a large number of lines
      in the blockquote and it would be tedious
      to prefix every line with a ">".
      
      Note that I can divide things up into
      paragraphs.
      
      <blockquote>And I can nest other
      blockquotes</blockquote>
      * and
      *# nest
      *# lists
      * too
      
      <pre>and include pre blocks as well.

      External links [http://example.com work too].
      As well as autolinks as seen http://example.com/

      Look at how we handle bad syntax. [[This is an unterminated
